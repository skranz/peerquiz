  Not yet working.
  Student peer review in form of a quiz game.
  Mainly used as an RTutor plugin.
  Students first write an answer text to an open question.
  Then they see several answers. One is the sample solution,
  others are answers from other students. They must guess
  which answers could be the sample solution. They get
  points if they guess correct or if their answer is
  guessed to be the sample solution.
